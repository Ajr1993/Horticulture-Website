            <p id="organic-mulch">
                Organic mulches are made from dead plant material such as compost, leaves, bark or grass clippings. Inorganic mulches include rocks or gravel but they can also include plastic sheeting, landscape fabric and 'rubber mulch'. Unlike organic mulches, inorganic mulches do not break down. Indeed some, such as plastic sheeting, can disintegrate over the years and pollute your garden environment. Inorganic mulches don't add nutrients to the soil and can, in some instances, stop nutrients reaching soils. 
                However they can offer a more long-term solution to weed suppression than organic mulches.

                <li ><strong>Leaf Mould:</strong>
                low in nutrients but an excellent soil conditioner, leaf mould provides a quick reward for a little effort. 
                    Simply bag up leaves in autumn and they should be ready to mulch around your plants after around 12 months.

                <li><strong>Horse Manure:</strong>
                    Well-rotted horse manure this is packed with nutrients and retains moisture well. It's excellent for mulching around hungry plants like roses and edibles, especially pumpkins and squashes. Make sure it's been left to rot for at least two years, 
                    otherwise it can 'scorch' plant leaves and even remove nutrients from the soil as it breaks down.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Composted Woodchips or Bark</strong>
                    this bulky mulch breaks down slowly and is ideal for improving soil structure by improving drainage and making it more moisture retentive. Also, its dark colour makes offsets the green of plants beautifully.
