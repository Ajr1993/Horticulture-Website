        <h2>Hanging Baskets</h2>
        <p id="intro-to-hanging-baskets">
            Preparation is key to achieving perfect, long-lasting hanging baskets.
            It's not the only important factor, though. Aftercare, particularly watering, is crucial to the success of your baskets. They're prone to drying out in hot weather, 
            so will need regular watering to prevent the plants from losing too much water.

            <h2>Benefits of Hanging Baskets:</h2>
            <li><strong>Provide Adequate Drainage:</strong>
                Cut holes in the plastic liner to allow easy drainage. 
                Some baskets come ready-lined, or you can easily make a liner yourself using an old compost bag.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Right Compost:</strong>
                Use a good quality multi-purpose compost, for example a loam-based compost, and add perlite to help with moisture retention and drainage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feeding Your Plants:</strong>
                Add slow-release fertiliser granules and distribute them evenly. Hungry plants will also benefit from a weekly dose of liquid plant food such as tomato fertiliser.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Positioning yourplants:</strong>
                Position tall plants in the centre of the basket. Place trailing plants around the edges and in any planting holes in the sides â€“ as they grow, they'll gradually disguise the basket.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deadhanging Flowers:</strong>
                    Deadhead fading flowers regularly to encourage continuous blooms throughout the summer.
