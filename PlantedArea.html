                <h2>Caring for a Planted Area</h2>
                <p id="gardening-for-beginners">
                    As a gardener, you need to care for your plants once they’re in the soil, making sure they’re well watered and fed, 
                    given adequate support and are not growing in competition with other plants or weeds. 
                    Caring for you garden as a whole involves caring for plants individually what works for one will not necessarily work for another.
                </p>
                <ul id="caring-for-plants">
                    <li><strong>Watering plants</strong>:Plants lose moisture from their leaves through a process known as transpiration, so it’s important to ensure there’s enough in the soil for them to reabsorb through their roots. 
                        However, in warm weather, moisture evaporates from the soil as well.</li>

                        <li><strong>Seedlings and young plants:</strong> These need watering more regularly than older, established plants, as they have smaller roots systems, so absorb less moisture. Planting and transplanting plants damages the tiny hairs on their roots, which are used to absorb water, 
                            so for the first few days after planting you'll need to give these more water, too. Plants grown in containers have restricted roots and less soil to absorb moisture from. So these also need extra watering than established plants growing in your border.</li>

                        <li><strong>Feeding plants:</strong>As well as water, plants absorb nutrients and minerals through their roots. These include nitrogen (N), which aids leafy growth, phosphorus (P), which encourages root development and potassium (K), 
                        which encourages flower and fruit development. These are considered the main nutrients required to keep plants healthy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pruning plants</strong>: Pruning is simply cutting off parts of a plant to restrict its size, encourage it to grow in a certain shape or develop more fruit, flowers or stems, or to remove dead or diseased material.</li>
