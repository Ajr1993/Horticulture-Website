            <h1>Propagation Techniques</h1>
            <p>Propagation is the process of creating new plants from existing ones. It is a key method for gardeners and horticulturists to increase plant numbers, maintain plant varieties, or grow plants from desirable characteristics. 
                Here are the most common techniques for plant propagation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed Propagation:</strong> The most natural method of propagation, where seeds from mature plants are sown to grow new plants. It’s often used for annuals, vegetables, and wildflowers</li>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> It’s cost-effective and allows for large numbers of plants to be grown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Seeds can take longer to grow and may need specific conditions to germinate (light, temperature, and moisture).</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cuttings:</strong> A piece of a plant (often a stem, leaf, or root) is cut off and encouraged to grow roots in water or soil. Common for many houseplants, shrubs, and some trees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick and easy; no need for seeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not all plants propagate easily from cuttings, and they may require special care to root. A cutting needs water and the 
                    correct temperature to grow, while warm and mosit conditions helps seeds to germinate.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Layering</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Description:</strong> A plant’s stem or branch is bent to the ground and encouraged to root.</li>
                      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple technique, especially for woody plants.</li>
                      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires time for rooting and specific soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Understanding propagation techniques helps gardeners grow healthy plants, save money, and preserve plant varieties. It’s an essential skill in horticulture and useful for both home gardens and professional plant production.</p>

                  <h3>Tools for Cutting</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secateurs:</Strong> Used to make clean cuts on stems or leaves. They should be sharp and clean to avoid damaging the plant or spreading disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small pots or trays:</strong> To place the cuttings in while they root.</li>
                    <li><strong>Propagator:</strong> Used to cover the cuttings and create a humid environment that encourages rooting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools and after care</strong> Always clean tools before and after use to prevent the spread of disease and ensure healthy cuttings.</li>    
                </ul>
                <h4>Health and Safety Tips</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Label all new plants to avoid confusion later.</li>
