            <h2>Propagation Techniques</h2>
            <p>Propagation is the process of creating new plants from existing ones. It is a key method for gardeners and horticulturists to increase plant numbers, maintain plant varieties, or grow plants from desirable characteristics. 
                Here are the most common techniques for plant propagation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed Propagation:</strong>The most natural method of propagation, where seeds from mature plants are sown to grow new plants. It’s often used for annuals, vegetables, and wildflowers</li>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong>It’s cost-effective and allows for large numbers of plants to be grown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong>Seeds can take longer to grow and may need specific conditions to germinate (light, temperature, and moisture).</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cuttings:</strong>A piece of a plant (often a stem, leaf, or root) is cut off and encouraged to grow roots in water or soil. Common for many houseplants, shrubs, and some trees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong>Quick and easy; no need for seeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not all plants propagate easily from cuttings, and they may require special care to root</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Layering:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Description: A plant’s stem or branch is bent to the ground and encouraged to root.</li>
                      <li>Pros: Simple technique, especially for woody plants.</li>
                      <li>Cons: Requires time for rooting and specific soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
